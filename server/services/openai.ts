GOOD EXAMPLE (copy this style exactly):
"Streetlights don't hum by accident. They're wired that wayâ€”linked to the grid, to the atmosphere, maybe even to data systems we don't see. That isn't paranoia; it's design. Numbers prove the point. Words are flimsy, decorative. Numbers carry the real code, the actual structure."

NOTICE: Short sentences. Simple words. Direct statements. No flowery language.

FORBIDDEN WORDS (use = instant failure): phenomenon, attributed, facilitate, surreptitious, exemplified, underscores, encapsulates, subtextual, latent, cognitive, elemental, pervasive, awaiting, fabric, gateways, manifestation, transcends, intangible, ethereal, conduit, clandestine, cosmic, encrypted, frequencies, interconnectedness, civilization, mysteries, enigmas, surreal, whispers, secrets, nocturnal, illuminate, reveal, unveil, extraordinary, hue, conversation, hidden, shadows

USE ONLY: simple everyday words like: hum, wire, grid, code, point, design, structure, walk, laugh, crack, mark, cup, jacket, sidewalk, year, place

RULES:
- Every sentence under 15 words
- Use words a 12-year-old knows
- State facts, not interpretations
- No metaphors or poetry

Instructions: ${instructions}

Rewrite using ONLY simple, direct language:

- Cut every unnecessary word. Be ruthless.
- State claims directly. No hedging, no qualification.
- Prefer active voice, strong verbs.

FORBIDDEN CONSTRUCTIONS: "The [noun] of [noun]," passive voice, abstract nominalizations, academic throat-clearing.

REQUIRED: Every sentence must add new information. No redundancy. No filler.

STYLE MANDATE:
- Short, punchy sentences. Vary length for impact.
- Use simple, concrete words. Intelligent â‰  polysyllabic.
- Cut every unnecessary word. Be ruthless.
- State claims directly. No hedging, no qualification.
- Prefer active voice, strong verbs.

FORBIDDEN JARGON (fail if present): "phenomenon," "attributed to," "facilitate," "surreptitious," "exemplified by," "underscores," "encapsulates," "subtextual," "latent significance," "cognitive dissonance," "elemental mode," "pervasive theme," "awaiting interpretation," "fabric of existence," "gateways to deeper truths."

FORBIDDEN CONSTRUCTIONS: "The [noun] of [noun]," passive voice, abstract nominalizations, academic throat-clearing.

REQUIRED: Every sentence must add new information. No redundancy. No filler.

Instructions: ${instructions}

Rewrite this text with maximum force and clarity:

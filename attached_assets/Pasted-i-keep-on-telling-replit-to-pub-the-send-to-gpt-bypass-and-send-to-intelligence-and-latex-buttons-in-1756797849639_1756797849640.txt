Here’s how to put those three buttons back into the normal toolbar row.

Find the component that renders them:

grep -Rni "Send to GPT Bypass\|Send to Intelligence\|LaTeX" .


Open that file and replace the wrapper around those buttons.

Before (typical culprit):

<div className="absolute right-2 top-2 flex items-center gap-2">
  <Button>Send to GPT Bypass</Button>
  <Button>Send to Intelligence</Button>
  <Button>LaTeX</Button>
</div>


or

<div className="ml-auto flex items-center gap-2">
  ...
</div>


After (inline with the rest of the toolbar):

<div className="flex items-center gap-2 flex-wrap">
  <Button>Send to GPT Bypass</Button>
  <Button>Send to Intelligence</Button>
  <Button>LaTeX</Button>
</div>


In the same file, fix the toolbar container so everything sits in one row and wraps cleanly.

Replace any of these on the toolbar container:

justify-between

justify-end

ml-auto

absolute … right-…

float-right

With exactly:

<div className="flex items-center gap-2 flex-wrap">
  {/* left group: Download TXT, Print/Save PDF, Download PDF, Use as Input, Transform Again */}
  …
  {/* RIGHT NOW: append your three buttons here, NOT in a separate absolutely positioned div */}
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <Button>Send to GPT Bypass</Button>
    <Button>Send to Intelligence</Button>
    <Button>LaTeX</Button>
  </div>
</div>


If that toolbar lives in a CSS/Grid parent, kill column shoves:

Remove grid-cols-2, col-start-2, or any place-self-end.

Ensure the toolbar wrapper uses: className="flex items-center gap-2 flex-wrap"

Save and rebuild:

npm run build && npm run dev


If you still see them “way off to the side,” you missed an absolute, ml-auto, or justify-end on an ancestor. Run:

rg -n "absolute|ml-auto|justify-end|float-right" src | rg -n "Bypass|Intelligence|LaTeX" -B2 -A2


and strip those from the relevant wrappers.

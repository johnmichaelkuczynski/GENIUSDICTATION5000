You're doing all the right thingsâ€”Tesseract + LaTeX formattingâ€”but the pipeline is brittle and fails silently or randomly. Here's what we do now, based on what you sent:

ðŸ”¥ DIAGNOSIS: Why It Fails
Tesseract is not built for mathematical layout analysis. It's for text, not formulas.

Mathpix works sometimes but has terrible consistency and flaky math segmentation.

You're likely mixing multiple OCR outputs into one pipeline without:

isolating math regions,

sanitizing OCR artifacts (e.g., extra brackets, spacing),

or verifying output before rendering/export.

âœ… SOLUTION (RECOMMENDED PIPELINE)
You're too deep in patchwork. Here's a robust plan that will work consistently, no guessing:

âœ… 1. Replace Entire OCR Stack with Im2LaTeX Model
Run Math OCR using deep learning, not classical OCR.

Use an open-source pre-trained Im2LaTeX model or API (e.g., Texify or Im2LaTeX).

These models take screenshot â†’ LaTeX directly. No Tesseract. No Mathpix. No glue logic.

You can use:

Texify API â€“ free, no signup

MathOCR â€“ commercial, but stable

Run Im2LaTeX locally with torch + prebuilt model if offline.

âœ… 2. Fix UI Display (USE KATEX, NOT MARKDOWN)
Render using KaTeX in browser. Not markdown. Not Jupyter-style rendering.

Inject in your HTML:
html
Copy
Edit
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.0/dist/katex.min.css">
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.0/dist/katex.min.js"></script>
Render with:
js
Copy
Edit
katex.render("x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}", document.getElementById("math"));
âœ… 3. PDF Export That Actually Works
Instead of trying to stitch together LaTeX or markdown and force PDF output, do:

Build final HTML page with KaTeX rendering all math

Use Puppeteer to export full DOM to PDF

js
Copy
Edit
await page.setContent(renderedHtml);
await page.pdf({ path: 'final.pdf', format: 'A4' });
ðŸ§  Final Recommendation:
Stop duct-taping OCR + LaTeX. Use a model built for math screenshot parsing.

ðŸ§¨ TL;DR INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT AGENT
Build math OCR pipeline using Texify API (https://texify.ai/api).
Send uploaded image to Texify â†’ get LaTeX â†’ render with KaTeX â†’ export with Puppeteer.

Would you like me to give you a Replit-ready demo app that uses Texify API + KaTeX + Puppeteer? Zero Mathpix. Zero Tesseract. One clean pipeline.

Build an app that enables universal dictation and advanced text transformation for professionals, with the following specific capabilities:

1. CORE DICTATION FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Allow dictation into any text field, including Replit's coding environment, other coding platforms, browser search bars (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Firefox), and any standard text input field.
   - Use a floating widget or keyboard shortcut to trigger dictation that inserts text wherever the cursor is positioned.
   - Ensure dictation works continuously without timing out during long sessions.

2. SPEECH-TO-TEXT INTEGRATION:
   - Primary: Use my Gladia API key (Curved Red Giraffe) for high-quality, low-latency transcription.
   - Fallback: Use my OpenAI Whisper API (via my existing OpenAI API key) if Gladia has issues.
   - Alternative: Use my Deepgram API key as an optional transcription engine that users can select.

3. INTELLIGENCE ENHANCEMENT:
   - Allow users to dictate directly into the app, then transform their rough text into polished, intelligent output.
   - Use my OpenAI API key (GPT-4o) for all text transformations and enhancements.
   - Provide a text field where users can manually enter custom transformation instructions, like "rewrite in the style of john-michael kuczynski. illustrate with examples about foundationalism, coherentism, skepticism, instrumentalism, and pragmatism. write at level of extremely..."
   - Include preset transformation options as well as custom instructions.

4. DOCUMENT HANDLING:
   - Allow upload of Word documents (.docx), text files (.txt), and PDFs.
   - Enable direct dictation into these documents at any cursor position.
   - Support document enhancement/rewriting using the same custom instruction interface.
   - Provide document download in the original format after modification.

5. REFERENCE TEXT & STYLE EMULATION:
   - Create a "Personal Style Humanizer" feature that lets users upload sample texts.
   - Allow users to tell the app to emulate the style of these reference documents.
   - Enable extraction and use of specific information from uploaded documents ("use quote 1 in your rewrite").
   - Support multiple reference documents for both style and content sources.

6. USER INTERFACE:
   - Clean, responsive design with dark mode.
   - Split-screen view showing original and processed text.
   - Drag-and-drop file upload area (supporting PDFs, Word docs, and images).
   - Custom instruction text area with clear guidance on how to specify rewrite parameters.
   - Toggle for using personal writing style.

7. API INTEGRATION & SECURITY:
   - Store all API keys (Gladia, OpenAI, Deepgram) in Replit Secrets.
   - Access these securely via environment variables.
   - Handle all error cases gracefully if API calls fail.

8. ABSOLUTELY NO CENSORSHIP:
   - The app must avoid content filtering and censorship as much as possible, except where strictly required by law.
   - Do not implement any moderation algorithms that might interfere with free expression.
   - Users must be able to explore any topic, from technical subjects to controversial areas, without interference.
   - The purpose is to help writers and professionals think and express themselves freely.

This app should serve as a complete replacement for typing, while also enhancing the quality and intelligence of the user's output. It's an intelligence amplification tool for professionals, not just a simple dictation or paraphrasing solution.

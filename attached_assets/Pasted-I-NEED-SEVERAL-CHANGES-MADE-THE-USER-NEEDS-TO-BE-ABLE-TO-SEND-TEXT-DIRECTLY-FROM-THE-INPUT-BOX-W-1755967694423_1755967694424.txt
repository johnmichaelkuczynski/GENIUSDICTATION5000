I NEED SEVERAL CHANGES MADE. 
THE USER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SEND TEXT DIRECTLY FROM THE INPUT BOX (WHERE HE DICTATES/TYPES/PASTES/UPLOADS THE TEXT HE WANTS TO ALTER)
DIRECTLY TO EITHER THE INPUT BOX FOR THE GPTBYPASS OR TO THE INPUT BOX FOR THE INTELLIGENCE TEST FUNCTION. 

THE USER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SEND TEXT DIRECTLY FROM THE OUTPUT BOX (WHERE HIS PROCESSED TEXT APPEARS, IE THE BOX AT THE TOP RIGHT THAT SAYS 
"processed text with mathematical notation will appear here") DIRECTLY TO EITHER THE INPUT BOX FOR THE GPTBYPASS OR TO THE INPUT BOX FOR THE 
INTELLIGENCE TEST FUNCTION. 

THE USER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SEND TEXT DIRECTLY FROM EITHER THE HUMANIZED OUTPUT BOX (BOX C) IN THE GPT BYPASS FUNCTION TO EITHER THE INPUT BOX 
(WHERE HE DICTATES/TYPES/PASTES/UPLOADS THE TEXT HE WANTS TO ALTER) OR TO THE INPUT BOX FOR THE INTELLIGENCE TEST FUNCTION. 


THE USER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SEND TEXT DIRECTLY FROM THE HUMANIZED OUTPUT BOX (BOX C) IN THE GPT BYPASS FUNCTION TO EITHER 
THE INPUT BOX (WHERE HE DICTATES/TYPES/PASTES/UPLOADS THE TEXT HE WANTS TO ALTER) OR TO THE INPUT BOX FOR THE INTELLIGENCE TEST FUNCTION. 

WHEN THE USER REWRITES TEXT USING THE REWRITE FUNCTION IN THE INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS TOOL, THE USER HAS TO BE ABLE TO SEND THE TRANSFORMED 
(MORE INTELLIGENT) TEXT TO EITHER THE INPUT BOX (WHERE HE DICTATES/TYPES/PASTES/UPLOADS THE TEXT HE WANTS TO ALTER) OR TO THE INPUT 
BOX FOR THE GPTBYPASS

THE DEFAULT MODE (IF THE USER INPUTS NO INSTRUCTIONS) IN REWRITE FUNCTION AT THE TOP OF THE APP (THE MAIN REWRITE FUNCTION, IE THE ONE WHERE 
THE USER CAN DICTATE/TYPE/PASTE/UPLOAD AND HAVE IT TRANSFORMED AS HE WISHES) MUST BE TO REWRITE THE TEXT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE REWRITE DOES
WELL WHKEN IT IS SUBJECT TO THE INTELLIGENCE TEST. IN OTHER WORDS, THE CRITERIA USED TO JUDGE INTELLIGENCE IN THE INTELLIGENCE-ASSESSMENT FUNCTION
SHOULD BE IDENTICAL WITH THE CRITERIA USED IN THE DEFAULT REWRITE INSTRUCTION. 

THE DEFAULT MODE (IF THE USER INPUTS NO INSTRUCTIONS) IN REWRITE FUNCTION IN THE INTELLIGENCE-ASSMENT FUNCTION MUST BE TO REWRITE THE TEXT 
IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE REWRITE DOES WELL WHKEN IT IS SUBJECT TO THE INTELLIGENCE TEST. IN OTHER WORDS, THE CRITERIA USED TO JUDGE 
INTELLIGENCE IN THE INTELLIGENCE-ASSESSMENT FUNCTION SHOULD BE IDENTICAL WITH THE CRITERIA USED IN THE DEFAULT REWRITE INSTRUCTION. 

DO NOT OTHERWISE ALTER THE EXISTING LOGIC OF THIS APP, WHICH IS VERY GOOD. THE EXISTTING INTELLIGENCE ASSESSEMENT FUNCTION WORKS VERY VERY WELL, 
AND SO DOES THE GPTPASS FUNCTION. AND THE REWRITE FUNCTIONS IN THE INTELLIGENCE/GENIUS DICTATION MODES WORK WELL, BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE JUST-MENTIONED
CHANGES TO THE DEFAULT MODES FOR THESE.
